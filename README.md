# Data-Mining-and-Machine-learning-Report
This research is provided in order to address the patterns in the real estate and environmental datasets. The research consist of 4 different tasks, that focuses on real estate price prediction, pollution detection classification, property clustering, and text-based recommendation systems. It evaluates the effectiveness of various supervised and unsupervised models: Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Ridge Regression, K- means clustering, and TF-IDF-based text similarity models with a diverse set of parsed datasets. The methodology follows the CRISP-DM framework and obliged to preprocess the datas, engineer features, and evaluate models with multiple metrics. The results demonstrate the ability of machine learning models to solve various real estate tasks in Ireland.
